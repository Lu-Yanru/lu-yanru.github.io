## About me
I am an MA student of linguistics at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. My current research interest lies in synax, semantics and their intersection with psycholinguistics. I work as a student assistant for Prof. Dr. Katharina Spalek in her ERC-Project [Focus alternatives in the human mind: Retrieval, Representation and Recall (FAHMRRR)](https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/en/fahmrrr/index.html?set_language=en).

## About my name
Lu ist my surname and Yanru is my given name. I prefer to put my surname in front of my given name, because we do so in my native language, Mandarin Chinese. It reads &#91;'lu<sup>35</sup> 'j&#603;n<sup>51</sup>&#635;u<sup>35</sup>&#93;.
