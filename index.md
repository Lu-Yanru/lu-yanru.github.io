## About me
I am an MA student of linguistics at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. My current research interest lies in synax, semantics and psycholinguistics. I also works as a student assistant for Prof. Dr. Katharina Spalek in her ERC-Project [FAHMRRR](https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/en/fahmrrr/index.html?set_language=en).
